Reconstruction Window
=====================

The reconstruction window contains the tools for center of rotation (COR) and tilt alignment, beam hardening correction (BHC) and tomographic reconstruction.

The main part of the window shows the currently selected stack in projection and sinogram space and a preview reconstruction of the currently selected slice. The slice can be selected by clicking in the projection view or using the controls in the Preview section.

Previews are automatically updated when parameters are changed. For reconstructions that take a long time to run, such as iterative algorithms, it is worthwhile to disable the Auto Update option and trigger preview updates manually using the Update Now button.
